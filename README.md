# LegalDino - Terms & Conditions RAG Assistant

A powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application (on development) to transform the way users interact with and understand Terms & Conditions documents. Say goodbye to tedious reading and hello to interactive, intelligent document comprehension.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to solve a common problem: making Terms & Conditions documents more accessible and understandable through an interactive chatbot interface. Instead of scrolling through lengthy legal documents, users can ask questions and receive relevant, context-aware responses.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Document Processing**: Automatically processes and indexes Terms & Conditions from various websites
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions in natural language about any part of the documents
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Get precise answers with relevant context from the source material
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interaction with the chatbot
- **Multi-Document Support**: Compare and analyze T&Cs across different websites

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahmanlibi47/project-blackhorse.git
cd project-blackhorse
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💡 Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Input the website URL or upload T&C documents
3. Begin asking questions about the content

Example questions:
- "What are my privacy rights according to this document?"
- "Can I cancel my subscription? What's the process?"
- "What happens to my data if I delete my account?"

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: The system processes and indexes T&C documents using advanced NLP techniques
2. **Query Processing**: User questions are analyzed for intent and context
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant information is retrieved from the indexed documents
4. **Generation**: Natural language responses are generated using the retrieved context
